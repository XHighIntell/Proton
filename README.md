Proton is written on the top of WebView2 control that enables you to embed web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) in your native applications powered by Microsoft Edge (Chromium). Proton inherited ideas from [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) where developers use web technologies in developing desktop applications.

## Technology backends

![.NET Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET%20Framework->=%204.7.2-brightgreen)
![.NET Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NetCoreApp->=%203.0-brightgreen)
![.NET Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft.Web.WebView2->=%201.0.1020.30-brightgreen)

[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) uses [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) as their backend while Proton's backend is .NET that allows developers to use .NET built-in features and better target for the win32.
